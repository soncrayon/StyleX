## Using StyleX

The StyleX web application is meant as an aspirational website presenting a variety of men's clothing.  To use, a visitor should navigate to the '/welcome' page and follow the links from there.  

A user my view current data--outfits and items available to create outfits without being logged in or having an account.  If a user wishes, however, to create their own outfits, they will need to create an account and be logged in.  

User accounts (and associated outfits) may be manipulated via CRUD features.  Users may create, add items to, and delete outfits.  Users can also create and delete their own accounts, which will delete all associated outfits.  

## System dependencies

StyleX is built on Ruby on Rails and makes use of the Rails server for its operation.  The site was developed and tested on Rails server as well. 

The styling of the website was developed for Google Chrome but may be viewed with other browsers, including Mozilla Firefox and Internet Explorer.  

## Credits

The seed data for StyleX was culled from a variety of sources, primarily Google Images and Unsplash.  The developers of StyleX assert no ownership over the photos used and have only included them to show the functionality of the application.
